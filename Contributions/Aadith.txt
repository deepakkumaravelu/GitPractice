Hi, I'm Aadith.

Sorry, I am 2 days too late for this. But my exams are coming up.

By the way, first time pushing to an upstream repository. 
Till date, almost all of my github experience has been practice with my own repositories, or CS50's repositories.

Gotta go fast and be consistent >>

Day 2 Update:

I finally got the upstream branch to connect, turns out that I was in the directory above GitPractice, and was trying
to add upstream from there. And also added a new repo like that. It took a bit of trial and error, before I finally
understood what the issue was.

This is my commit for Day 2 - Instructed to be pushed without raising an issue.
