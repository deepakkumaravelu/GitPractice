Hyy everyone ðŸ‘‹
I am Ankush
My second PR(update repo)-
OFFTOPIC THOUGHT :
if you never created or updated file with CLI in windows os before. let me help you out use below command. 
command : echo text you want to add or append >> Name of you file
Explaination : 
echo - left side echo is used to display text in windows os. 
>> - if you want to append text in file. 
filename - at right side of >> you will put name of the file example abc.txt 

#STASH

Lets Take a Scenario
Suppose you are a kid and you bought some choclates
now your relative kid is coming and 
you dont want to share with him or throw your choclate. 
so you just hide the choclates somewhere so you can have it later.

Stash works with the same logic 
when you do not want to push the code to remote
and you do not want to store the code on local machine either 
so you can stash the code and use it later.

>create stash or with unique name
git stash  or git stash -m "name you want to give"

>see all stash
git stash list

>get last stash from stash
git stash apply

>if you want to get a particular stash
git stash apply stash@{put stashno from stash list}

>if you want to delete top most stash
git stash pop

>if want to delete particular stash
git stash drop stash@{put stashno from stash list}

>clear stash 
git stash clear

>create branch with stash
git stash branch "name of branch" stash@{put stashno from stash list}

!!imp diff btw git stash apply and git stash pop 
    git stash bring back the stashed code without removing it from the stash
    get pop bring back the stashed code and remove it from the stash

#REMOTE BRANCH

>create a branch in local machine stage changes
git branch nameofbranch   or   git branch -b nameofbranch 
git add .                 or   git add filename
>create commit Msg
git commit -m "write some commit msg" 
>create remote branch
git push origin main
>or if you want to rename it 
git push origin main:namesometing
>Or you want to creates a remote branch and sets it upstream of the current branch(basically connect the remote and local branches when pushing commits.)
git push --set-upstream origin  or  git push -u origin


#Day4
remote means you are refering to some url which is on the remote. 
origin is the alias that you are giving it to it
ex - git remote add [name] [the url you want to refer]

>To check remote
git remote -v

>To add remote 
git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git

>To remove remote
git remote rm origin

Diff - upstream refers to the original branch , remote refer to forked branch in your github

#squash
means to combine multiple commits into one

>when code is not pushed only commited(n is no of commits)
git rebase -i HEAD~n
git push origin <branch> 

>when code is pushed(n is no of commits) (you need to force the push)
git rebase -i HEAD~n
git push origin <branch> --force

commit- Line1
commit- Line2
