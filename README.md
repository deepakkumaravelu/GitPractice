## Daily Tasks

Each day, we will have a set of tasks to help you learn and practice git. Follow the tasks for each day to progress smoothly.

### Day 1

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Clone the repository to your local system (ensure that you are cloning the forked repository).**  
   To fork, run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/GitPractice.git
   ```
   Replace **`<your_username>`** with your GitHub username before running the command in your terminal.
3. **Create two issues and wait until they are assigned to you.**
4. **Once assigned, complete the tasks as per the issue descriptions.**
5. **Create a pull request (PR).**

### Day 2

#### Task 1: Update the Forked Repo by GUI and CLI

- **GUI Update**:

  - Use a Git GUI tool (e.g., GitHub Desktop) to update your forked repository.
  - Locate the option to sync or update your repository.
  - Follow the tool-specific steps to perform the update.

- **CLI Update**:
  - Open your terminal.
  - Add the upstream repository as a remote (do this only once):
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo/original-repo.git
    ```
  - Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```
  - Merge the changes from upstream into your local branch (e.g., main):
    ```bash
    git merge upstream/main
    ```

#### Task 2: Create a Branch by Your Name

- Create a new Git branch with your name as the branch name.
- Example branch name: `arshad`
- This branch will be used for your future contributions.
  ```bash
  git checkout -b arshad
  ```

#### Task 3: Push the Branch Without Creating an Issue

- Push the branch you created in Task 2 to your forked repository on GitHub.
  ```bash
  git push origin arshad
  ```

#### Task 4: Do Git Status and Write Your Commit Number When You Push the Code

- Run git status to check the current status of your working directory.
- When you push the branch created in Task 3, note down the commit number provided by Git.

  ```bash
  git status
  ``` -->
